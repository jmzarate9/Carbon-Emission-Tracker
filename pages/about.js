                        Welcome to my humble corner of the web, where we're all about tracking carbon emissions and making a positive impact. This project started as a personal quest to understand and address our environmental challenges.
                        </p>
                        <p className={aboutStyles.paragraph}>
                        I'm excited to mention the contribution of <a href='https://www.carboninterface.com/'>Carbon Interface</a> and their API, which significantly aids in collecting precise carbon emissions data for our platform. Thanks to their technology, we're able to offer you valuable insights into your environmental impact.
                        </p>
                        <p className={aboutStyles.paragraph}>
                        This isn't a corporate endeavor â€“ it's a personal passion project. Join me in exploring our carbon footprints, learning, and collectively working toward a greener future. Together, we can make a real difference.
